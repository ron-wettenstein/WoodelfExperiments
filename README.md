# WoodelfExperiments
Experiments performed with the Woodelf algorithm as part of the paper “From Decision Trees to Boolean Logic: A Fast and Unified SHAP Algorithm,” published at AAAI-26.

The notebooks were executed on Google Colab. The runtime type (CPU, high-memory CPU, GPU, etc.) and other technical details are documented within the notebooks, in the paper, and in its full version.

We also published a Python package containing our latest code:  
**[WoodElf Python Package](https://github.com/ron-wettenstein/woodelf)**

Install it using:
```bash
pip install woodelf_explainer
