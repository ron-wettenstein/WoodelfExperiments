# WoodelfExperiments
Experiments performed with the Woodelf algorithm as part of the paper “From Decision Trees to Boolean Logic: A Fast and Unified SHAP Algorithm,” published at AAAI-26.

The notebooks were executed on Google Colab. The runtime type (CPU, high-memory CPU, GPU, etc.) and other technical details are documented within the notebooks, in the paper, and in its full version.
